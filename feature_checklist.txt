- Repost detection.

- Subreddit stats JSON file.

- Automatically report rule-breaking posts.

- Have a buffer of subreddits to be checked, so if many posts are being submitted, it won't miss once that are awaiting evaluation.
	Eg:
	- Post is posted.
	- Wait time is 5 minutes. Loop delay is 10 minutes. Get posts are set to the 3 per loop.
	- Post is postponed evaluation to wait until wait time is up.
	- Three more posts are posted.
	- Loop delay runs 10 minutes later, and the original post is missed because it is then not the first 3.

- Have the configuration file hosted remotely, and be accessible and editable by all the mods.
